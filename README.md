# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is one of my first programs I have created using Python, so it is pretty simple! It is just a rock, paper, scissors game. A user may input an option and the program will generate a random opponent choice. The results of the game are displayed for the user!

I think the code for this is pretty self explanatory, and there are comments to make it clearer if necessary!
